### Summary:
This project utilizes HTML and CSS styles to build out a dashboard that offers the user a way to input goals and visualize these goals in a dynamically minipulated pie chart. We take use of multiple APIs and Third Party APIs to leverage the DOM in a manner that delivers the user data calculators for varity of health and wellness elements. The user has options to maintain a journal of persisting text through out the week by way of local storage and can offer emotional icons to generate a motivational quote.
